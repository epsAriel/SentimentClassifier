# Cyberbullying Detection on Social Media

Cyberbullying has become a prevalent issue in today's digital age, with the widespread use of social media platforms. The impact of cyberbullying on individuals, especially on the mental and emotional well-being of victims, is significant. Detecting and addressing instances of cyberbullying is crucial to creating a safe and inclusive online environment.

This project focuses on the important task of detecting cyberbullying on social media. By leveraging the power of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, we aim to develop an automated system that can identify and classify instances of cyberbullying in social media posts.

## Features

- Data Exploration: Users can examine the dataset to gain insights into the provided social media posts and their corresponding labels.
- Data Preprocessing: Users have the option to preprocess the data using various techniques, such as removing duplicates, converting letters to lowercase, cleaning and splitting strings, removing stopwords, and fixing spelling mistakes.
- Model Training: Users can choose from multiple training models, including logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), and random forest, to train a classification model on the preprocessed data.
- Post Classification: Users can input a social media post, and the system will classify it into one of the cyberbullying categories.
